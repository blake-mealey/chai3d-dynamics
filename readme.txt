CPSC 599.86 Winter 2018
Assignment 4
T. Blake Mealey

Controls:
	Space:			Toggle workspace lock for the current scene (so you cannot move the workspace)
	Left:			Cycle scenes left
	Right:			Cycle scenes right
	1:				Spawn a heavy sphere at (0, 0, 1) in the current scene
	2:				Spawn a light ball at your cursor position attached by a "rope" spring (only applies force to
					correct elongation) in the current scene
	3:				Toggle the visibility of the mesh for the current scene
	Device button:	Delete objects touching the cursor

Notes:
	- Green springs denote close to natural length
	- Red springs denote longer than natural length
	- Yellow springs denote shorter than natural length
	- "Springs" on the second scene and on the balls attached to the cursor are "ropes"
	- As easily visualized by pressing 3, the third scene has the basic horizontal spring connections described
	  in the assignment. The fourth scene adds criss-cross springs which results in a much stronger mesh.
	- I attempted to get torsion springs working but failed.	:(

Issues/Bugs:
	No known issues.
